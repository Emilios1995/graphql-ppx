title: Not supported yet
---

`graphql-ppx` targets to support 100% of the GraphQL spec. And we would like to
be compatible with every GraphQL client. However we are not there yet. These are
some of the things that are not supported yet, but we would like to support in
the future:

- Overlapping interface selections
  [#92](https://github.com/reasonml-community/graphql_ppx/issues/92)
- Explicit null in arguments
  [#26](https://github.com/reasonml-community/graphql_ppx/issues/26)
